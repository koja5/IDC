      "First impression": ".....and  a golden eagle flew out of the planes that exists between the dewdrops, as if a mirror slid open and he was released. He was majestic. His wings spanned to eternity and he flew towards me, bold and  fearless. As he circled above, and I caught his eye and he whispers , come fly with me. I knew then he was free….",
      "Appearance": "Black Cherry.",
      "On the Nose": "Silky aromatics , reminiscent of rain",
      "On the palate": "Slender, medium-weight, black plums and spiced , smoky acid. Short finish.",
      "Final thoughts": "This was my first experience in wine mixing.  I discovered that straying too far from the known isn’t the best thing to do when it is the  first  time. Experimenting with a broad  merlot base in a year where an Indian summer, a wet harvest and a late-ripening favoured cab savs over merlot ,resulted in a wine that is at best a pleasure for the enthusiast but for the connoisseur, another year in wait. Still,time will tell."
