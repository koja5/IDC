      "First impression": "My pets have always been my masters and teach me so many things that make me human. They teach me love, devotion, commitment, strength and tenacity. When we  lost Blu, I knew I would loose Orange too. She had a broken wing and was small and weak next to Blu. But in the relentless  search for Blu, I saw her bloom into a defiant spiritchaser. My heart could have broken watching her struggle but who was I to have interfered with  a love so deep and all I could do was to hold her close, till she too was struck by the light that would take her home to her Blu.",
      "Appearance": "Deep black Cherry.",
      "On the Nose": "Cassis , Tabacco bouquet",
      "On the palate": "Slender, medium-weight, black plums and spiced , smoky acid. Short finish.",
      "Final thoughts": "TIf the previous year didn’t teach me any lessons not to stray far from the known, then I  could only learn by being even bolder this year. Luckily , 2015 was the quintessential merlot year and chasing my true heart in merlot didn’t go too far wrong. Still I’m just a baby at wine mixing so as stellar as 2015 was supposed to be, there is still more learning to do. TIme will tell."
